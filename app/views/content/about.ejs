  <p class="lead">
    I am studying at Centennial College Health Informatics Technology program and it is my third semester. Near to my current education, I also have a BA in Economics, and have completed a certificate program in Fashion Management and Styling, and Googleâ€™s data analytics certificate program. Before coming to Canada, I was working in the defense industry in different roles. After immigration, I had a survival job at Tim Hortons as a baker.
    Outside of education and work, I am a fashion enthusiast, and I love snowboarding, although I didn't get a chance to do it here in Canada yet. I am also an animal lover.
    Changing careers and stepping into the tech world was a challenge by itself, but I find myself enjoying it more and more. I am willing to transition into a data administration role where I can further improve my knowledge.
